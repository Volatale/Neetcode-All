//* Time: O(n) - We keep track of the consecutive frequencies in the stack
//* It takes Î±(1) time to push to the stack, and O(1) to pop from it
//* Then we have another loop to rebuild the string - at worst, this takes O(n) time

//* Space: O(n) - At worst, the input is entirely unique
//* That means the stack would have "n" elements
//* "sonic" -> [["s", 1], ["o", 1], ["n", 1], ["i", 1], ["c", 1]]
//* Length 5
