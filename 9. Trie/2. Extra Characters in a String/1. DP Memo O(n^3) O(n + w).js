//* Time: O(n^3) - We call "dfs" "n" times without using the memoized values
//* Within each call, we do a loop that also scales with n (in the worst case)
//* The loop contains a substring call, which can take O(n) in the worst case as well
//* O(n * n * n) === O(n^3)

//* Space: O(n + w) - The depth of the recursion is "n"; we move forward by 1 index each call
//* Since this is 1D DP, the memo object stores "n" keys where each key is an "index" in "s"
//* The space used by the substring is transient; it only exists briefly and is not stored on each stack frame
//* "w" represents the space used for the set (in other words, w === dictionary.length)
