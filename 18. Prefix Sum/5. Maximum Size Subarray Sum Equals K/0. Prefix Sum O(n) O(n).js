//* This problem involves prefix sums
//* We want to find the LONGEST subarray that sums to "k"
//! Since nums[i] can be negative, we cannot use a Sliding Window approach
//*     - Why? Because extending the window may or may not put us closer to the goal
//*         - If our sum is 4 and we need to reach 6, the next element could be a -2, but it also may be a +2 (positive)
//*         - So we either get 4 + - 2 = 2, or we get 4 + 2 = 6, there are two possibilities at each step
//*         - We don't have consistent logic we can follow to know when to expand and/or shrink the window
//*     - Thus, the invariant of "A smaller subarray of a valid window should also be valid" is not true
//* Instead, we use a hashtable to keep track of the subarrays we have found thus far, and the index they END at
//* There is no need to repeatedly calculate the same subarray
//*     - We can use a prefix sum to track the cumulative running total as we traverse the array
//* We can apply the formula:
//*     - k = pref_i - pref_j
//*     - Thus, all we have to do is find some subarray "j" (that may or may not exist in the hashtable)
//*         - And then subtract / remove that from our current subarray (i) to reach "k"
//* pref_j = pref_i - k
//* So when we ask "sumToIndex[prefixSum - k] !== undefined", we are actually asking:
//!      "Is there a subarray (pref_j) that equals prefixSum - k (that exists in the hashtable)
//!       that we can remove from the current subarray (pref_i)?
//!       If there is, the removal of that subarray leaves us with k (which is our goal)"

  //* Hashtable to map the last known (end) index of (prefix sum) subarray that sums to "value"
  //* Assume that there is always a way to get a subarray sum of 0 (take no elements)
  //* 0 : -1 because if pref - k = 0, we don't need to remove any subarray: n - -1 = n + 1 (include first element)
