//* Time: O(n) - We have to process every node in the tree (both arrays)
//* It takes O(n) time to populate the indices object
//* Since we have that object, it takes Î˜(1) to find values in inorder
//* There will be "n" recursive calls to build

//* Space: O(n) - The number of keys in indices scales with the number of nodes - O(n)
//* We create a new node for every element in the arrays - O(n)
//* The depth of the call stack scales with the height of the tree
//* If the tree is balanced, the depth of the call stack is O(log n)

//* Space: O(h) - The depth of the call stack scales with the height of the tree
//* If it is balanced, the space used is O(log n)
