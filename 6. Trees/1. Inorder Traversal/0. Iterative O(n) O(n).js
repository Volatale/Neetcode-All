//* Inorder Traversal is in this order: L N R
//* Instead of using the callstack and recursion
//* We should use an explicit stack
//* Popping the stack lets us travel back UP the tree, like a return in recursion
//* In the recursive version, we travel left all the way
//* When we reach the base case (null node), we pop the stack and go back up the tree
//* The base case being curr === null
//* Then we push the current node and go right, rinse and repeat
//* So we know we have to use a while loop here
//* The call stack uses stack frames, so we can model this using our own stack
//* Each node we visit we will push to the stack so we can return there later on
//* Afer the inner while loop's condition is no longer true
//* Travel right (which is exactly what happens in the recursive version)

//* Time: O(n) - The time taken scales with "n", which represents the number of nodes
//* The inner while loop does not activate once for every node we have
//* Instead, we just process each node once (O(n)); it takes Î±(1) to push to an array
//* Then it takes O(1) to pop from an array

//* Space: O(n) - At worst, the tree resembles a linked list
//* In which case the stack will hold all "n" nodes at the same time
